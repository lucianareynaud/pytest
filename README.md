Before you begin, make sure to run this command in your terminal to install pytest:
```
pip install -U pytest
```
Then, to run pytest, just enter:
```
pytest
```
Right now, not all of the tests should pass. Fix the function to pass all its tests! Once all your tests pass, try writing some additional unit tests of your own!
